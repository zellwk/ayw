**Learn Javascript showed me the full landscape of the Vanilla JavaScript ecosystem.** Everything Zell taught laid an important foundation, and I immediately get to use them on practical projects.

I became more confident with my existing skills and I filled up any gaps I had. **Every time I jump into the course I learn something to deepen my javascript knowledge**, and I become more marketable for work in the future.

I’ve become more confident writing Javascript. I’ve increased my Javascript knowledge, and **I’ve also saved a lot of time searching around the internet** trying to learn what Zell has put all together in one incredible resource.
