**Learn JavaScript is the best way to learn JavaScript**. I never found anything like it out there. It *starts all the way from the beginning*. And it shows you understandable code examples all the way through.

The course pushed me forward in my coding career. *JavaScript became fun* to write. **I no longer avoid JavaScript.**
