Learn JavaScript empowered me as a frontend developer. **I went from knowing nothing about JavaScript to building a custom design system for my company entirely in JavaScript**. What's more, each component I build is also accessible thanks to Zell's accessibility lessons.

This the best course to learn JavaScript quickly. It is super practical, we get to build actual components we see and interact in the browser everyday, unlike most courses which go into abstract uses of JavaScript. Learn JavaScript is also very easy to understand.

Now, **I know how build my own components**. I know how to start, how to code it up, and how to search for (and understand) the parts that I donâ€™t know yet. **This course gave me the confidence to call myself a front-end developer**.
