Learn JavaScript is worth it! There's nothing out there like it. I used countless other books and courses before, but they did not give me the applicable knowledge I needed to be a solid frontend developer. **Learn JavaScript is the only course that gave me that knowledge**.

I learned so much from Learn JavaScript. **I learn to apply JavaScript to make actual components**. And I get to improve the components with concepts like keyboard accessibility and screen-reader accessibility.

**I can build pretty much whatever I want now!** I can even build things from scratch without relying on 3rd party libraries.
