I love Learn JavaScript. **This course is a fail-safe system for learning JavaScript**. If you want to really understand JavaScript, this is the only course you'll need.

Zell breaks *everything* down into *simple understandable* blocks. He encouraged and empowered his students to ask questions, which helped me learn a lot.

<!-- Now, **I feel comfortable writing and reading Javascript**. I also feel comfortable making mistakes and debugging my code -->
