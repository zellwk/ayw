**Learn JavaScript is the best and most helpful JavaScript course I found.**

I used to think that JavaScript is overwhelming and hard. This course breaks JavaScript into *doable chunks*. Each lesson is *clear and concise*. I don't feel overwhelmed or confused as I go through them.

**I gained the confidence that I can not only understand JavaScript, but I can master it.**
