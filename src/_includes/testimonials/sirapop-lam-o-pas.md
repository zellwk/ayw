I've been trying to understand CSS transitions and animations for so many times, and I failed each time in the past.

**I never thought I would understand CSS transitions and animations while learning JavaScript, but I did.** The CSS transitions and animation lessons in Learn JavaScript is so clear and easy to understand. This is beyond my expectation.
