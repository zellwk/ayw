I thought the price seemed a little high at first but I always found Zell's content informing and easy to understand so I bought the course, and I'm glad I did!

**The content in Learn Javascript is easy to understand** and laid out in a way that builds in the areas you need to know for web development fundamentals. Even for an industry veteran like myself, **I've found that knowing the fundamentals** is most important, regardless of what framework you decide to work in.

I highly recommend taking this course whether you're starting out or already experienced in Javascript.
