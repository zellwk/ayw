**Zell explains things in a way that no other instructor has been able to do** in my 15+ years of trying to "self educate" in the world of Javascript.

In this course, **Zell integrates every piece of JavaScript theory into building real UI**. He shows you how to *build simple things*, then how to *refactor the code* with useful modern techniques.

**Learn JavaScript helped increase my confidence** at JavaScript. I've since refactored our style guide at work to *completely remove jQuery*. I also have the confidence to *start a Vue project*.
