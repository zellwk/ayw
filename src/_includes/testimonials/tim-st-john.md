Most courses out there aren't very beginner friendly. They assume you already know some stuff and they just zip through things with little or no explanation. But Learn JavaScript doesn't.

I loved the way things are presented in Learn JavaScript. The explanations are very clear. **This course makes it very easy to learn with the examples and source code** provided.

I haven't finished the entire course yet, but I would recommend it. It has been excellent so far.
