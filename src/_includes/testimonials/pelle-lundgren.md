**Learn JavaScript takes you through all the steps in building the components.** The course *doesn't stop* after the first steps. It shows you how to *improve the component* and *include best practices*.

This is something I found so hard to learn from other courses. I finally started to **understand how to move on from a beginner level to an intermediate level.**
