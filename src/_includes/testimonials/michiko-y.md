**I would have given up on JavaScript if I didnâ€™t join Learn JavaScript**. This course is well structured and *beginner-friendly*. Zell and other students are *always there to answer my questions* when I get stuck.

Now, I can help newer programmers with their questions. I can even understand books like Eloquent JavaScript!
