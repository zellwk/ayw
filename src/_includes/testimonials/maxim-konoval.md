At first, I didn't know if Learn JavaScript was worth it. I was familiar with the first ten modules already. But now, **I'm halfway into the course and I totally love it.**

**Learn JavaScript** gave me a **deep understanding of the language** and its capabilities. I gained new perspectives on things I already know, and I learned new things like Forms and APIs.
