I wasn't sure if Learn JavaScript was going to be any different from other JavaScript courses out there. But Zell proved me wrong.

**Learn JavaScript is the ONLY course that helped me understand JavaScript**. It explains JavaScript in depth with lots of examples. It also helped me learn to think like a developer.

Now, **I can build some applications myself**, I can understand other developers' code, and I can give answers to questions on Stackoverflow.
