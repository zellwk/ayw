### Can I really learn JavaScript?

**You will learn JavaScript.** I've structured the course to clarify everything you need to know about JavaScript so you don't waste your time and money.

- You get analogies to help you understand abstract concepts.
- You will learn why, when, and how to use each JavaScript
  concept.
- You will think like a developer as you build real-world components in the course.
- You will know how to use best practices.
- If you get stuck, you can ask questions and we will get back to you.

**I can guarantee you'll learn JavaScript successfully** â€” but only if you go through the course!

### How long do I need to study before seeing results?

**Your understanding of JavaScript will completely change within a few hours.** You can expect to know these at the end of the first 3 modules:

- Module 2 â€” you understand when, why, and how to use JavaScript
- Module 3 â€” you will think like a developer
- Module 4 â€” you will know how to begin building complex stuff

Your understanding of JavaScript will continue to increase after you complete each module.

### How is Learn JavaScript different from other courses?

**Learn JavaScript shows you how to build real-world components** â€” things you can use in your work daily. You'll learn how to build them step-by-step so you can recreate them from scratch.

- You learn to build the simplest version first
- Then you add more features
- Then you make your code clean and maintainable

**You will become a professional** at JavaScript.

### Does Learn JavaScript contain video?

No. **We teach JavaScript via articles in Learn JavaScript**. Each article contains images, gifs, and videos to help you understand what's going on.

We teach through articles because:

1. **Reading is a critical skill** for developers since most documents are text-based.
2. It's much easier for you to **find information** from text
3. It's much easier for you to **retain information** from text
