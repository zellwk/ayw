        You get two 60-minute video calls with me if you grab the Guided Instruction package (more on this later). You can redeem these calls anytime, subject to my availability. No expiry deadline.

        **You can ask me anything you want during** these calls. I can help you:

        - Review your code
        - Debug your code
        - Pair program with you
        - Answer any questions you have (even if they're not JavaScript related).

        <p></p>

        You get access to a community of students who're learning JavaScript â€“ like you. **You can ask questions, provide answers, and form accountability groups to nail down your JavaScript knowledge.**

        I'll also hang out in the community to help answer questions. You can find me there almost every day.
