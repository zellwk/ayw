        I have a bold aim for Learn JavaScript â€” **When you complete the course, you can build anything you want from scratch without Googling for answers**.

        <div class="pull-quote">

        </div>

        I improved the lessons over and over based on past students' experiences. **You'll learn the right things in the right order**. I'm here to ensure you have the best possible experience with JavaScript.
